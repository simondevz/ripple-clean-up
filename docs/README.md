#### 4. Token Rewards:

Users are rewarded with blockchain tokens for their clean-up efforts. These tokens can be used for various purposes: - Donating to environmental causes and organizations. - Exchanging for discounts at eco-friendly stores. - Trading with other users. - Redeeming for cash rewards.

Rewards are only sent after verification by the waste collection points you submitted to.

#### 5. Data Analytics:

We keep a record og the transactions being made and we display them so that people that come to the site will see the impact we make and be encouraged to do more. For now the only metrics measured are number of waste collected and amount rewarded. But as the site grows we will be able to measure in terms of recycled wastes, best performing WCP and the likes.
